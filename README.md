# Public-Opinion-on-Drugs
This is a project I am working on to explore how public opinion about drugs in America over time correlates to the arrest rate for possesion and usage of illegal drugs in America since 1990. I think that whether or not a relationship exists would be an interesting finding, as a correlation or lack thereof would could provide insight into how we think about drugs in America and why we arrest people for crimes involving illegal drugs. This is espeically important in the post-Reagan era of the 1990s as we can see the effects of the War on Drugs and how it relates to the public's perception of drugs.
